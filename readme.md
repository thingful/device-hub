[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thingful/device-hub.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thingful/device-hub)

Transforms output from one or many IOT devices via one or many protocols into a common semantically understood format.
The logic to transform the data is via a "device profile". Device profiles are written in java-script.

Introduction
------------

device-hub is operated by installing a set of configured listeners, endpoint and device profiles.

device-hub is configured via the device-hub-cli.

device-hub stores its running configuration in a local boltdb database.

device-hub can run in insecure mode or using TLS in a mutual authentication model. See [security.md]( docs/security.md ) for details

Supported message formats

Transport               | Notes
------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------
`CSV`                   |
`JSON`                  |
`RAW BYTES`             |

Supported listener transports

Transport               | Notes
------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------
`HTTP`                  |
`MQTT`                  |

Supported endpoints

Transport               | Notes
------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------
`STDOUT`                |
`HTTP`                  |

Example configuration files are in ./examples/config/

The entity connecting a listener to a device profile and then an endpoint is called a 'pipe'.

On startup device-hub will restart all existing pipes.

Platforms
---------

device-hub supports all the platforms golang supports.

The Makefile contains build targets for linux amd64, raspberrypi arm and darwin (mac).

Development
-----------

If you need to do changes into the .proto files you will have to:
- [Download]( https://github.com/google/protobuf ) and install the protocol buffer compiler.
- Run ```make get-build-deps``` to get protobuffer dependencies installed.
- Run ```make proto``` to compile proto files.

Build
-----

Install golang, docker (if you want to run the integration tests or test with a local mqtt server)

Get the code

```
go get github.com/thingful/device-hub

```

The Makefile is documented

```
make help
```

Run the tests

```
make test
```

Build executables for all platforms

```
make all
```

Output is built to ./tmp/build/

Run the Server
---

Start the device-hub server, the server instance can be customized with env vars, flags or a config file, the precedence order is:
<br>
```Config File > Flags > Env Vars```
<br>
 [More init configuration info.]( https://github.com/thingful/device-hub/blob/master/docs/server.md#cli-global-flags )

```
./device-hub server
```
Client
------
The device-hub client [configures]( https://github.com/thingful/device-hub/blob/master/docs/client.md#client-cli ) the server instance.

To import a folder of configuration files

```
./device-hub-cli create -d=./examples/config/
```

Files can also be imported on an individual basis

```
./device-hub-cli create -f=./examples/config/mqtt_listener.yaml
```

The running configuration can be inspected

```
./device-hub-cli show all
```

Create some 'pipes' that listen via http on uri /a and /b and output to std output

```
./device-hub-cli start -e=stdout-endpoint -l=http-listener-local-port-8085 -u=/a thingful/device-1
./device-hub-cli start -e=stdout-endpoint -l=http-listener-local-port-8085 -u=/b thingful/device-2
```

It is possible to 'tag' messages with some user defined information when starting the 'pipe'

```
./device-hub-cli start -e=stdout-endpoint -l=http-listener-local-port-8085 -u=/c -t=foo:bar thingful/device-3

```

In the above example any messages received on '/c' will be tagged with the key value pair "foo" and "bar"


Send some messages 

```
curl -X POST -d '{"my-value": true}' 0.0.0.0:8085/a
curl -X POST -d '{"value": "22", "deviceId": "23", "createdAt": "1488205809000"}' 0.0.0.0:8085/b
```

Pipe through from MQTT -

Start the MQTT server

```
docker-compose up
```

```
./device-hub-cli start -e=stdout-endpoint -l=mqtt-listener-local-port-1883 -u=/some-mqtt-uri thingful/device-2
```

Send a message via mqtt to 0.0.0.0:1883 e.g. using MQTTLens (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mqttlens/hemojaaeigabkbcookmlgmdigohjobjm?hl=en)
